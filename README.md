Anagram task solution

I believe there are many solutions to the task you assigned to me but I thought of two easy ways to solve it, I hope they are sufficient

Note: I changed the names of the methods, I hope that is not a problem, also I left my simple 'testing data' in the file

Task:
An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to form a new
word, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram
can be rearranged into nagaram.

Using PHP, JavaScript or any language of your choice, implement a function
“is_anagram” that takes two words, and returns true if the second word is an
anagram of the first, and false if not.

is_anagram(‘hello’, ‘hlleo’) == true
is_anagram(‘test’, ‘tast’) == false
